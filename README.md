# Color by Number

A program that converts images into color by number art projects. 

## Description

Program allows you to edit size of the coloring squares and whether or not the output is already
colored in.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* PIL (python image library)

### Installing / Setup

PIL should already be installed by default. To set up, move image into the project folder. 
Ensure that path in main.py is correct. Set 
colormode to FALSE for standard black and white 
color by number sheets or TRUE to see the filled
in version. Edit the size of the squares by 
adjusting the clump size variable (smaller clump size = smaller squares).

### Executing program

Navigate to project folder, then run the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```
